	  <p align="justify" >Since 2010, the 326 British local authorities have been seriously hit by austerity. According to the Institute for fiscal studies, their budget is on average <a href="https://fullfact.org/economy/local-authorities-budgets/">26% lower than before austerity began. </a> </p>
	  <p align="justify">Since 2018, <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/local"> Bureau Local </a> has started to investigate on the repercussions of austerity on the local authorities budgets and activity. 
	  <p align="justify"> Cuts in social services, education or culture, problems to balance the budget and cutting in their reserves, selling their assets to finance redundancies, the Bureau Local network has found out that local authorities are struggling a lot to overcome the situation. </p>

	<p> How does each local council or region got affected? As Bureau Local <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/local/open-resources"> publishes all their data </a>, this website will expand on their work and will try to break down their national dataset into local perspectives. </p>

	  <p> Bureau Local initiated its investigation into Local authorities' finances back in 2018. 
	  
	  </p>
	  <p> Bureau Local’s dataset compiles all <b>353 English local authorities</b>. Local authorities – which are local governments - are broken down into two distinct categories, between 2-tier and 1-tier local governments.
			  </p>
	  	
		<h5> <center>  <b>Local authorities: what scale? </center> </b></h5>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em"> - First, twenty seven <b> county councils </b> form the upper-part of <em> 2-tier local governments </em>, from Kent to Gloucestershire to Leicestershire. All of them deal with services like education, transport, fire and public safety, libraries or social care. Within these counties, 201 <b> districts councils</b>, that are in charge of issues like housing, recycling or council tax collections.
</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em">
- Secondly, 125 <em>1-tier local governments</em> form the rest of the country, from <b>unitary authorities</b> (mainly in the cities, urban areas and larger towns like Bristol, Portsmouth or Southampton) to the 32 <b>London boroughs </b> to <b>metropolitan districts</b> (which together cover 6 large urban areas: the counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire)

	<h4> <center> Since 2013, five years of spending cuts </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em">	If local authorities makes most of their money out of council tax, fees and charges, they are also dependent from Government grants. As this income source has dropped significantly, local finances got severely hurt. 
Let’s have a look at the total service expenditure of each local authority. By services, it is understood everything related to Education, Public health, police forces, social care, highways, etc.
The scatter plot below maps all local authorities regarding how much they cut in percentage and numeric in their global service budget:

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em">
By plotting the percentage difference by the numeric difference between 2013-14 and 2017-18 total service expenditure, we can have an overview of the global trend or reduction costs at stake. The bigger the circle, the bigger the global service expenditure in 2017-2018.
Then,two trends can be differentiated.
<br>
On the one hand, a big part of small local authorities, with a global low budget, have seen their percentage of service expenditure drop consequently. Some of these governments cut 20% or more of their budget: Runnymede and Spelthorne are extreme examples, as they saw their expenditure drop completely, by more than 50% for the first and almost 100% for the second. </p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em"> 
On the other hand, local governments with bigger budgets strongly cut in their service expenditure: almost twenty county councils and metropolitan districts cut at least 100 million of their global service expenditure, like the city of Sheffield, the London borough of Enfield or the county council of Cornwall. Above all, Birmingham is at the top of the ranking: the second city of England spent nearly 250 million less than in 2018 than five years before.

		<h4> <center> Austerity: a quick geography </h4>
	<br>
	<p align="justify">
	Which region suffers the most from spending reductions? The map on the right is based on all local authorities’ evolution percentage between 2013 and 2018 and gathered within each region. </p>
	<p align="justify">
	Some patterns emerge out of this map. Even though London, the richest area of England, suffered a 9% loss, the regions that resisted the most are the wealthiest, East Midlands and East of England. </p>
	<p align="justify">
	In the meantime, the zone that cut the most in its service expenditure is the north eastern part of England. Already classified among the poorest in the country, it suffered even more in its global service expenditure, as local governments in this region lost in average almost 15%. </p>

	  <h5> What about London and its boroughs? </h5>
	  London is an interesting case. As the capital is broken down into 32 boroughs + the City of London, each of them has a budget to deal with all types of services, like housing, education, social care or libraries. Here, there are no clear geographical patterns, as most boroughs reduced their expenses quite strongly (more than 9% on average).
	  <br>
	  But among them, some got more strongly hit, without specific geographical patterns.
