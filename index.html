	<h4> <center>  <b>Digging into local budgets: what scale and focus? </center> </b></h5> </center> </b></h4>

	  <p> Bureau Local started its investigation into local authorities' finances back in 2018. Its datasets compile different data on the <b>353 English local authorities</b>. Local authorities – which are local governments - are broken down into two distinct categories, between 2-tier and 1-tier local governments:
	  </p>
	  
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em"> - First, twenty seven <b> county councils </b> form the upper-part of <em> 2-tier local governments</em>, from Kent to Gloucestershire to Leicestershire. All of them deal with services like education, transport, fire and public safety, libraries or social care. Within these counties, 201 <b>districts councils</b> are in charge of issues like housing, recycling or council tax collections.
</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em">
- Secondly, 125 <em>1-tier local governments</em> form the rest of the country: they are either<b>unitary authorities</b> (mainly in urban areas and larger towns like Bristol, Portsmouth or Southampton) or <b>London boroughs</b> or also <b>metropolitan districts</b> (which together cover 6 large urban areas: the counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, and West Yorkshire)
</p>
<p align="center"> Here is a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=en&mid=1S_AbfmYbOpHBeyLEcmB9f-wRD4Y&ll=52.985571389544745%2C0.5478728645141473&z=6">link for an interactive map </a> showing the different layers of local governments.

 <h6 style="text-indent:2em"> What focus </h6>
 <p align="justify">
 
This project will focus on two datasets. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-w5Jg-H8YQAqH9MNxJVOZtFTj2fR9ZUGMI_5OTarIxc/edit">The first one</a>, released in February 2018, delves into service expenditure evolution between 2013 and 2018. By services, it is understood everything related to education, Public health, social care, highways, etc.
<br>
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lsC2BM9fG7h6DFi2ke6srwnVKRnzTRe741lmOkDnPB0/edit#gid=0">The second one</a>, published in March 2019, digs more into how some local authorities sold some of their assets to fund reforms and finance redundancies, a measure allowed by the English government in 2016.
	  </p>

	<h4> <center><b> Since 2013, five years of spending cuts</b> </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em">	If local authorities make most of their money out of council tax, fees and charges, they are also dependent from Government grants. As this income source has dropped significantly, local finances got severely hurt, hence affecting their global expenditure as local governments are asked to become more and more independent from public funds.
</p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em"> Let’s have a look at how each local authority's service expenditure evolved during this period: the scatter plot below maps all local authorities regarding how much they cut in percentage and numeric in their global service budget:

	<h6> <b> Spelthorne, 94% of budget reduction in five years </b> </h6> 
	<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em"> 
	<br>
	On the one hand, a big part of small local authorities, with a global low budget, have seen their percentage of service expenditure drop consequently. 
	<br>
	Some of these small governments cut 20% or more of their budget, while <b>Runnymede</b> and <b>Spelthorne</b> saw their expenditure drop completely, by more than 50% for the first and almost 100% for the second. In the same investigation, Bureau Local also pointed out how <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2018-12-04/councils-borrow-billions-to-buy-real-estate">both governments were gambling on the property market with public loans and were accumulating huge debts.</a> </p>

	<p align="justify" style="text-indent:2em"> 
		
	<br>
	On the other hand, local governments with bigger budgets strongly cut in their service expenditure.	Almost twenty county councils and metropolitan districts cut at least £100m of their global service expenditure, like the city of <b>Sheffield</b>, the London borough of <b>Enfield</b> or the county council of <b>Cornwall</b>. 
	<br>
	Above all, Birmingham is at the top of the ranking: the second city of England spent nearly 250 million less than in 2018 than five years before. </p>

	</br>
	</div>
	
			<div class="row">
	 	<div align="justify" class="col-9 offset-md-1" >
	<p> Let’s focus now on a different type of local government: unitary authorities (UA). Mostly constituted of large towns (Bristol or Leicester for instance) and larger areas (like Cornwall), these authorities are single-tier local governments responsible for all local services, contrary to district councils.
	This case study analysed the service expenses of the ten most populated UAs and focused on some specific budgets: <b> education</b>, <b>culture</b> and  <b>Public health</b>. 
	<br>
	The first graph gives an overview of the global service expenditure evolution of these councils in the past few years. Overall, each UA had to cut in its services budget, even though the situations are not all similar: <b> Northumberland </b> (the largest unitary area in England, at the border with Scotland) , <b>Cheshire East </b> (close to Liverpool) and <b>Wiltshire</b> (East of Bath) governments have the service budgets that dropped the most, respectively by 14, 13.5 and more than 12%. In the meantime, a local government like <b>Leicester</b> cut relatively smoothly in its expenses, by around 2%.

		<div class="row">
	 	<div align="justify" class="col-9 offset-md-1" >
		<br>
	<p align="justify"> When digging deeper into the main service budgets, different trends are to be depicted. <br>
	First, <b>education</b>. Local education authorities have many responsibilities, from distribution and monitoring of funding to the employment of staff in community schools. the governments also generally own the school lands and buildings of the sector.
	<br>
	Within the studied period, most of the ten populated unitary authorities have cut in their education budget (<b>go and check the figures on the graph below</b>). 
	</br>

	  			<div class="row">
	 	<div align="justify" class="col-9 offset-md-1" >
		<br>
		<p style="text-indent:2em">
	
		Except the UA of <b>Cheshire West and Chester</b>, that catched up after cutting in its budget, most of the UAs' education budget dropped more or less significantly.
		<br>
		Many among the ten biggest unitary authorities cut between 30 and 40m pounds in their education expenses over a five-year period. Governments like <b>Bristol</b> or <b>Wiltshire</b> even saw their expenses drop by around 50m pounds. This represents respectively 17% and 19% of their education budget.
		<br>
		
		<h6 style="text-indent:4em"> Culture </h6>
	  <p> <b>Culture</b> got also affected during this period (<b> see chart below</b>). Here culture is understood in a wide meaning, as it wraps together library services, archives, tourism and open spaces. </p>
	  </div>
	  
	  		<iframe src="https://plot.ly/~GalloN14/15.embed"

	  	  </iframe>
		

	 	<div align="justify" class="col-9 offset-md-1" >
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>	
		Every unitary authority studied reduced its culture budget, but some of them cut in this area more drastically. 
		<br>
		<b>Northumberland</b> (North East) cut its culture budget down by 50%, while <b>Shropshire UA</b> (West Midlands) reduced it by almost 55%.
		<br>For the 2017-2018 fiscal year, the latter had a budget for tourism which was 90% lower than the one in 2013-2014, while its budget for open spaces dropped by more than 70%.
		
		<br> Further investigation would be helpful to analyse to what extent this type of culture and education reduction affected the authorities and their communities.
		<br>
		</p>
		<h6 style="text-indent:4em"> Public health </h6>
		<p>
		Interestingly, public health received increased attention from these ten authorities during that period (<b>see graph below</b>).
		</p>
		  </div>
		  
		  <iframe width="100%" height="500

		   </br>
	  </br>
		  </iframe>
<div align="justify", class="col-9 offset-md-1" >
<br> <br>
<p>Most local authorities raised their public health expenditure to a certain extent over this period.
The Durham authority for instance raised its expenses by £9m, focusing specifically on investing in sexual health services and tobacco prevention. 
<br>But this comes at the expense of other services, like their public health programs for children, whose budget dropped by around 80% or their obesity prevention scheme for adults, plumetting by more than 50%.
</p>
<p>
<br>
During this period, local authorities had to cut in a lot of services to offset the effect of the austerity era. However, in this moment of financial distress, some local authorities went further in their economic policy, sometimes at the expense of any long-term vision.

<h4> <center> <b> Redundancies: selling assets in order to finance redundancies? </b> </h4>

<p> <br> A striking example from Bureau Local’s new investigation back in March 2019 is how some local authorities sold some of their assets in order to finance redundancies. 
The story starts back in 2016: Bureau Local explains in its <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CjDSTvo_8WaIp3BCBRI5RTA0T8pmHw2ZSkbJSTBHxA4/edit"> <i> reporting recipee </i> </a>:
</div>

<div align="justify", class="col-7 offset-md-2" >
<p>
“[In 2016], the government relaxed the rules around sell-offs for councils in England. It gave councils the power to use proceeds raised from selling land and buildings they own (called “capital receipts”) to fund reforms to their services - as long as the measures generated “ongoing savings”. Previously, such one-off monies could only be used to fund the purchase of new assets, or to repay debt. The term given to using this type of money in this way is “the flexible use of capital receipts.”
<br>
"An investigation by the Bureau has found that since the new policy was introduced, 64 local authorities - one in six - have used money generated by selling publicly-owned spaces to fund reforms. Among these authorities, two thirds have used the cash to fund redundancies. The average number of redundancies at larger  councils that have used capital receipts in this way is 75 per cent higher than at those that have not.”
<br>
</p>
</div>

<div align="justify", class="col-9 offset-md-1" >
<p> Here are plotted the 38 councils that sold assets to finance redundancies. For information, the sell-offs from the county of Cumbria (North West) helped pay for only 14 redundancies out of 418 since 2016. </p>

	<div align="justify", class="col-9 offset-md-1">
	<br>
		An outlier, Birmingham shows to an extreme extent how local authorities deal with their financial situation. <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2019-03-04/sold-from-under-you"> Bureau Local’s reporting on Birmingham’s selling of the boxing club’s facility </a> exemplifies how communities are getting sacrificed on behalf of cutting policies.
		<br>
		Other figures from Bureau Local's dataset showed that some of these sell-offs got much underpaid compared to their value price. But since the organisation asks for 
		the people working on these data to go and confirm the figures with the councils, this project will only direct to the spreadsheet link for more information.

		<h4> <center> What future for local governments? </h4>
		<p>
		These few graphs have illustrated the situation in which most local authorities are at the moment. As most of them are struggling to find resources to properly finance their services, some of them even have to sell some of their assets in order to finance redundancies or to fund reforms. This shows the financial distress in which local governments are at the moment: unable to have any long-term vision, some authorities are selling their patrimony. Birmingham’s example shown
